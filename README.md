## Evolutionary Algorithms
q1: Finding the MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) of a Steiner Tree, with the help of evolution <br>

q2: Finding the global maximum of the Eggholder function, with the help of evolution <br>

## Fuzzy
FCM: Fuzzy c-means algorithm, runned on a couple of datasets <br>

FkNN: Fuzzy k-nearest neighbor algorithm, runned on the same datasets (indicating the borders of the clusters) <br>

## Neural Networks
ANN-1: simple plot <br>

ANN-2: single-layer neural network architecture used for regression on 2d dataset points (linear regression) <br>

ANN-3: multi-layer neural network (1 hidden layer) architecture used for regression on 2d dataset points (non-linear regression) <br>
